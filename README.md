# Overview

This a basic typing game for students playable in the browser. I got the idea from my mother-in-law Carmen who asked if I knew of any program that she could have her studens practice typing on. I decided to make my own using JavaScript. The user has to type a word out before it hits the bottom of the screen and if they do, they get a point, otherwise they lose. The number of points gotten after 30 seconds or before failing to type a word in time is the end score. The default program has a word bank of 83 words taken from spelling bees, 30 second timer and about 9 seconds for the user to type each word before failing. The program currently only works on desktop/laptop, but mobile support is not very important since the purpose is keyboard typing practice. Eventually I would like to add the ability to create rooms and have the teachers create their own rooms and adjust word banks, total time, each word time, record individual practice times, and a scoreboard, with a code word for each room to give to students.

# Development Environment

I used JavaScript for all the programming, along with html and css to build the website.

# Useful Websites

MDN web docs published a tutorial for a classic game "breakout" using pure JavaScript. I found their website quite helpful along with the always useful w3 schools syntax pages.

# Future Work

- Ability to create and keep track of rooms
- Have rooms be locked with a code and admin privelages of each room with a password
- Add admin privelages for adjusting word banks, total time, word fall time, record individual practice times, and a scoreboard
- fix other keys typing out words, ie. ESC types out escape.
